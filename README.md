# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This is the back end part of the WTWR project, using MongoDB, Postman, mongoose, express.js. I created an API, the routes and there controllers, handled possible errors that might occur in case of any problems, with there corresponding error codes and messages. In the near future I will be implementing use authorization and authentication then connect the front-end and back-end together to have a fullstack application.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 13
